# SIC Assembler Compiler

Welcome to the SIC Assembler Compiler repository! 🖥️🛠️ This project provides an assembler and compiler for the Simplified Instructional Computer (SIC), a pedagogical computer used for teaching assembly language programming and computer organization.

## 📜 Overview

The SIC Assembler Compiler project includes tools for assembling and compiling code written for the Simplified Instructional Computer (SIC). This project is ideal for students and educators looking to work with assembly language and understand low-level computing concepts.

## 🚀 Features

- **Assembler:** Converts SIC assembly language code into machine code.
- **Compiler:** Translates SIC assembly code into executable object code.
- **Symbol Table Management:** Generates and manages symbol tables for resolving labels and addresses.
- **Error Handling:** Provides detailed error messages and debugging information for easy troubleshooting.
- **Documentation and Examples:** Includes comprehensive documentation and example programs to guide users through the process.

## 📥 Installation

To get started with the SIC Assembler Compiler, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sic-assembler-compiler.git
   cd sic-assembler-compiler
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment:**
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed. Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Assembler:**
   Assemble SIC assembly code with the provided script:
   ```bash
   python assembler.py --input path/to/your/assembly_code.asm --output path/to/output/object_code.obj
   ```

4. **Run the Compiler:**
   Compile SIC assembly code with the provided script:
   ```bash
   python compiler.py --input path/to/your/assembly_code.asm --output path/to/output/executable_code.bin
   ```
