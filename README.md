Here are the Introduction and Features sections for the sic-assembler-compiler- project:

Introduction
SIC-Assembler-Compiler- is a project focused on developing an assembler and compiler for the Simplified Instructional Computer (SIC) architecture. SIC is a hypothetical machine architecture often used in computer science education to teach assembly language programming and compiler design. This project provides tools for assembling SIC assembly code into machine code and compiling programs written in higher-level languages for the SIC architecture, offering a comprehensive learning resource for students and educators.

Features
SIC Assembly: Converts SIC assembly language code into machine code or object code, following the SIC instruction set and format.
SIC Compiler: Includes a compiler that translates higher-level language programs into SIC assembly language, preparing them for assembly.
Symbol Table Management: Manages symbol tables to handle labels, variables, and addresses within the assembly code.
Error Detection: Provides mechanisms for detecting and reporting errors in assembly code and compilation processes.
Documentation and Examples: Extensive documentation and examples to guide users through setting up the environment, writing SIC assembly code, and using the compiler and assembler.
